Message passing system by writing one (or more) servers and having several clients talk to the 
servers. Clients choose a server at random and sends a file to its port. The 
Server reads from its port and recieves. 

Will write a detailed readme later.

This is essentially an UDP protocol.

License is MIT, but please don't copy code if you are also doing the same project. This was a lot of 
fun to implement and I don't want you to miss out on the fun if Prof. Dasgupta assigns the same
project to you.
